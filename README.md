# Love-2d-tile-Game-Base
Why reinvent the wheel when you can get started with a player collision system?

This provides a tile-based map, a working player, and a tile-based collision system for [Love2d](https://www.love2d.org).
# Before you pick this one up . . . 
[I actually made a second one](https://github.com/blehmeh98/BlehsLove2dTile_Base_2.0), this time with entities built in, and a few other things done for you. You should probably start with that newer one unless you want something more barebones so that you can customize it to your liking, in which case, you should mess with this.
