# (terrible) Love-2d-tile-Game-Base
I wrote this thing in middleschool. It's pretty garbage. That said, it at least provides an example of drawing with a tile system, and separating player logic from world logic. Other than that though, it's not very good in general; for instance, the collision is terrible.

I revisited it, and made one small change to one line to make it compatible with modern LOVE versions so you don't have to boot up an ancient version of Love 2d to get it working. It'll work with Love 11.5. However, it was designed with Love 8.0 in mind. If you need to get this working in Love 8.0 again for any reason, you can go back a commit to undo my change and make it work. 

Original README proceeds as follows:

Why reinvent the wheel when you can get started with a player collision system?

This provides a tile-based map, a working player, and a tile-based collision system for [Love2d](https://www.love2d.org).
# Before you pick this one up . . . 
[I actually made a second one](https://github.com/blehmeh98/BlehsLove2dTile_Base_2.0), this time with entities built in, and a few other things done for you. You should probably start with that newer one unless you want something more barebones so that you can customize it to your liking, in which case, you should mess with this.
